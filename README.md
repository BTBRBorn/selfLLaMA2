# About
This repository is a from scratch implementation of LLaMA2/3 models.
You can see my implementations of RoPE(Rotary Position Encodings), KV cache,
GQA(Grouped Query Attention), SwiGLU activation which are essential components of modern LLMs.
For now, I will implement single gpu training and inference. Later I might modify it for
multi gpu training.
